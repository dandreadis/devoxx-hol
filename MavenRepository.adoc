= Custom Maven repository

If you copied the maven repository from one of the USB sticks, that we passed around in the lab, you need to tell maven to pick up the files from there.

The most simple way is to use the `settings.xml` in this directory, modify it to reflect the location of your local repository (the place where you unzipped the USB stick contents) and then copy `settings.xml` over to `{user.home}/.m2`
